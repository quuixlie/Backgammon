# About
This game was written during my 1st year computer science studies. A few programming errors that I would now correct in this project are: not hiding external libraries behind its API (move(), printw() etc.), removing magic numbers (second screenshot) and a few more programming errors.

# Installing
The game was tested on Ubuntu, so I recommend it for this project. C11 version required, libncurses6 (6.5-2).
